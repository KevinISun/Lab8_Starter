Graceful degradation and service workers are related because services workers are a max technology feature, and when we implement services workers in a web app, when max technology features are enabled, it makes our webapp much faster compared to when we don't implement it. However, we should implement methods so that if service workers don't work, the webapp will still function, albiet slower to a decent degree, and without the features offered by the services workders.
